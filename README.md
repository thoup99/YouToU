Installation
============
  To begin you will need to download FFMPEG and add it to your path. It can be download from their website [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). To Ensure you've set everything up correctly watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECI72XEox0) video on setting up FFMPEG for Windows.  
  Next download the latest release. Thats it.  
  
  If you wish to use the python script it is worth noting that pytube library will need to be installed. Run __`pip install pytube3`__ to install.
